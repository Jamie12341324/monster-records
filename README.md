# UX
# Audience
The main target audience for this website is 12 to 18 year old boys.
People that have started watching media with higher age ratings and grown to
like and tolerate monsters in films. These monsters have an element of horror
, some scenes with death (monsters eating people) and actors acting about trauma.
The main target audience know this type of monster and wants to watch films
about them. The audience is also a fan of youtube raps about monsters and other characters.
# Purpose
The purpose is to talk about the monsters and give a brief explanation about a key part
of a monsters story like the awakening, diamond muscles, golden bones and the molten core.
Also to show musical videos to get across who the monsters are and generate a connection.
However these things all support the main purpose which is to sell monster cinema tickets 
and DVDs. The way the support works is to help make the audience feel the monsters are epic
by showing some cool wallpapers, great music and new stories. The intention was to have a 
relevent advertising panel but time did not permit this.
# Project goals

# Structure Plane
## Wireframes made in penpot
* Apart from my home page which dosen't use boostrap grids all of my 3 other pages have the same wireframes
because they all have the same structure apart from which background image, text and video they have
they are the same
* Apart from my home page my other pages are responsive when you change the size of the screen the
tables stack on top of eachother using a boostrap grid system
* while using penpot I had the issue of exporting the wireframes I had made which didn't work very well
because I only seemed to be able to download one file even though there were 5 so I had to move each one to the top
of the list before exporting it. Later markdown was unable to show any of my PDFs so I used snipping tool to get the wireframe
images that I actually used in my readme file which the links to are below

# Debugging
# problem 1
The navbar button wasn't working and when you click on it nothing happens the issue was I was missing a 
link from bootstrap that goes at the end of your code just before the closing body tag.
---
![image of navbar button having dropped down like it is meant to](assets/images/images-for-readme/error1.PNG "navbar button")
---
# problem 2
The issue here was the navbar appears on the side of the screen instead of the top to fix this I added the fixed-top class to the
nav tag
---
![image of side navbar](assets/images/images-for-readme/error2.PNG)
---
# problem 3
Here you can see the newer version with the navbar at the top
---
![image of fixed top navbar](assets/images/images-for-readme/error3.PNG)
---
# problem 4
Orignally the red background was on top of the footer so it looked like part of the footer was missing
if I remember correctly I fixed this problem by adding the fixed-bottom class to the footer
---
![fixed footer](assets/images/images-for-readme/error4.PNG)
---
# problem 5
This is a failed attempt to fix the same problem
---
![broken footer](assets/images/images-for-readme/error5.PNG)
---
# problem 6
This is a image of a fixed url that had ../assets at the start instead of ../images
---
![fixed url](assets/images/images-for-readme/error6.PNG)
---
# problem 7
For a while when I was trying to use an iframe to embed a youtube video I got an error 153
however when you look at the page from github as a deployed site the video/iframe works
---
![working video](assets/images/images-for-readme/error7.PNG)
---
# problem 8
Orginally when the header position was fixed it moved down with the navbar which I thought looked wrong
I also tried a postion relative but that brought back the problem with the footer so in the end I used
a position absolute which works
---
![working header position](assets/images/images-for-readme/error8.PNG)
---
# problem 9
When I first made the table for age and height the columns were too close together so I
tested a style with extra width. In the end I made a class called table-1 and set the width
to 150 solving the isssue so that there is enough distence between the columns so that you can read the text
---
![table styling](assets/images/images-for-readme/error9.PNG)
---
# problem 10
This is what the table looked like after it had been styled
---
![table with extra width](assets/images/images-for-readme/error10.PNG)
---
# problem 11
When I first did this class I forgot a few selectors like div tr
---
![table class with the right selectors](assets/images/images-for-readme/error11.PNG)
---
# problem 12
First I tired to import a button from boostrap
---
![button tag](assets/images/images-for-readme/error12.PNG)
---
# problem 13
I needed a link from the book now button to the booking-form page but the <a> (anchor tag) link made the text
on the button blue and highlighted
---
![button with a tag and highlighted blue text](assets/images/images-for-readme/error13.PNG)
---
# problem 14
I tried making my own button but it took up the whole screen so I scraped it
---
![](assets/images/images-for-readme/error14.PNG)
---
# problem 15
I changed my button so that the button tag was inside an <a> (anchor tag) tag instead of it being the other way around.
This solved the issue of the whole button going white when you hovered over the very edge (when you hover over the
text the text goes black so you can still see it) this might be because I had some styles for the <a> (anchor tag) and button tag 
that were pretty much the same and the bootstrap was overwriting the button tag class but not the <a> (anchor tag) tag so things only 
changed while you hover over the <a> (anchor tag) tag which just has text.

# html validator
These are the issues I got when I put my index.html page into html validator.
![The problems I had when I first put my index.html file into html validator](assets/images/images-for-readme/index-html-validator.PNG)
---
# problem 16
Here we have a tag I deleted like the validator suggested.
---
![tag ending problem](assets/images/images-for-readme/index-valid1.PNG)
---
# problem 17
According to the html validator I should not have this frameborder attribute so I got rid of it.
---
![frameborder problem](assets/images/images-for-readme/index-valid2.PNG)
---
# problem 18
I was missing a main closing tag so I added one in and it looks like this and after I put my page back into the validator it said
there were no errors. This is the html validator passing with no errors.
---
![missing closing tag](assets/images/images-for-readme/index-valid3.PNG)

# godzilla.html problems
These are the issues I got when I put my godzilla.html page into html validator.
![The problems I had when I first put my godzilla.html file into html validator](assets/images/images-for-readme/godzilla-html-validator.PNG)
---
![](assets/images/images-for-readme/godzilla-html-valid-fix1.PNG)
---
# problem 19
Here there was a / for no apparent readon so I got rid of it.
---
![](assets/images/images-for-readme/godzilla-html-valid-fix2.PNG)
---
# problem 20
Here the validator picked up that there was a p tag that was closed but never opened so I removed it
There was also a frameborder that got removed just like with the index.html page. After putting
the page back into the validator there were no more errors. This is the html validator passing with no errors.
---
![godzilla.html passing html validator with no errors](assets/images/images-for-readme/godzilla-no-issues-html-validator.PNG)

# king-ghidorah.html problems
These are the issues I got when I put my king-ghidorah.html page into html validator
![The problems I had when I first put my king-ghidorah.html file into html validator](assets/images/images-for-readme/king-ghidorah-html-validator.PNG)
---
# problem 21
There was also a frameborder that got removed just like with the index.html page and also similarly a / that I removed I also added a closing main tag. None of which I have images for king-ghidorah because I already have a image of all those issues for other pages. After putting the page back into the validator there were no more errors. This is the html validator passing with no errors.
---
![king-ghidorah.html passing a html validator with no errors](assets/images/images-for-readme/king-ghidorah-no-issues-html-validator.PNG)

# rodan.html problems
These are the issues I got when I put my rodan.html page into html validator
![The problems I had when I first put my rodan.html file into html validator](assets/images/images-for-readme/rodan-html-validator.PNG)
---
All the issues with the rodan page were the same as the king-ghidorah page and now the validator says there are no errors.This is the html validator passing with no errors.
---
![rodan.html](assets/images/images-for-readme/rodan-no-issues-html-validator.PNG)

# booking-form.html problems
These are the issues I got when I put my booking-form.html page into html validator
![The problems I had when I first put my booking-form.html file into html validator](assets/images/images-for-readme/booking-form-html-validator.PNG)
---
# problem 22
![form with no white spacing](assets/images/images-for-readme/booking-forn-validator1.PNG)
Here there was the issue with the accidental / which has now been removed. The other six issues are pretty much the same issue where I incorrectly used white space on a label id but 3 times for input tags and 3 times for label tags. This is the html validator passing with no errors.
---
![booking-form.html passing a validator with no errors](assets/images/images-for-readme/booking-form-no-issues-html-validator.PNG)

# success.html problems
![html validator check with no poblems](assets/images/images-for-readme/success-html-validator.PNG)

# css validator
The first time I put my css into the validator it said there were no errors so I don't have any issue fixing for it.

# Tests laid out with images and bullet points
* Test 1 is the navbar and footer sticking to the top and bottom when you move the screen which works
* Test 2 the content is positioned so the footer and navbar don't stop you seeing it which it does
* Test 3 you can play the videos on the godzilla, index/home, rodan and king ghidorah pages which works
* Test 4 the text is visible and the text stands out as white on mostly dark backgrounds
![Top of the home page](assets/images/images-for-readme/final-index-page-testing1.PNG)

![Top of the godzilla page](assets/images/images-for-readme/final-godzilla-page-testing2.PNG)
---
* Test 5 the tables on the godzilla, king ghidorah and rodan pages are reponsive so they stack when the screen is too small to see them all at once. Here we have images of the tables each at 1/6, 1/3, 1/2 and 1/1 of the full screen for sizes xl lg md and default
which could represent viewing on desktop tablet and mobile which has seemed to work in the images below

![resized godzilla page](assets/images/images-for-readme/final-godzilla-page-testing2-grid3.PNG)
* Test 6 the background images fill the avaliable space and are behind the main content which I think is true 
for all the pages
![king ghidorah page](assets/images/images-for-readme/final-king-ghidorah-page-testing1.PNG)
![rodan page](assets/images/images-for-readme/final-rodan-page-testing1.PNG)
* Test 7 the form has all fields required before any information can be submited which is true
![form page](assets/images/images-for-readme/final-form-page-testing2.PNG)
* Test 8 once the form is correctly submited the user is taken to a success page to show everything has worked 
which it does
![form success page](assets/images/images-for-readme/final-success-page-testing2.PNG)
* Test 9 the site has a custom 404 error pag which you can see in the image below

# How do you deploy your site?
A guide to publishing a site on github was found at 
[Link to guide on publishing](https://www.educative.io/answers/how-to-make-your-site-live-on-github-pages)
To add a new file you use the git commands 
git add new_file_name 
git commit -m "comments about the new file"
git push
To update changes to a existing file use
git commit -m "comments about the changes" 
and git push
This works for a single developer.
If other developers have cloned and changed the site
then you should do a git pull command to download the 
other developers changes. This was discovered when I 
updated my readme on the github site and I had to pull
the latest readme file back onto my computer before github
would let me push any changes.
Some information and advice on this was obtained
from stackoverflow.com via google
# How to make a github repository
first you click on new or the plus icon in the top-right for a new repository
![creating repository1](assets/images/images-for-readme/deploy2.PNG)
Then you need to name your new repository
![creating repository2](assets/images/images-for-readme/deploy3.PNG)
Then go to terminal in visual studio code which is at the top-left and go new terminal.
Then type out the new commands in the terminal in the image below to link you visual studio code folder to
the github repository.
These are the commands
…or create a new repository on the command line
echo "# deploy-test" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Jamie12341324/deploy-test.git
git push -u origin main
![creating repository3](assets/images/images-for-readme/deploy4.PNG)
The images from github repository and deployment were made by using snipping tool on [github.com](https://github.com/Jamie12341324/deploy-test)
# Deployment
The first time I had to delpoy my site I 
went to settings in github and selected pages.
Then I selected the main branch to deploy from 
and clicked save. Then I waited for my url to appear.
Some help was obtained from the guide mentioned above.
![image of deployment](assets/images/images-for-readme/deployment.PNG)
# Bugs
The booking form dosen't display on a phone properly and that would be the next thing to fix
